This Website was built on A mean stack.
I got permission from Duncan to do this.

You can find all my html in the views folder. They are labelled as ejs files because thats what they are. but they also serve as HTML files aswell like php.
ejs is embeded javascript which allows me to interact with the server from the html file.

css can be found in the public directory under stylesheets.

For most of the site logic. you can look in routes. all files in that folder are what deal
with user interaction on the site. these files deal with url handling and interacting with the backend.

javascript and some image assets can be found in the public directory aswell.

There is alot of content in this and all of It is my own except for the Bootstrap css
library I use. However I did write my own css aswell.
since basically the entire website uses javascript. front end and back, you can find my javascript in most of the files.

everything I used is opensource and free to use.
Because of this anyone can see and use this website on gitlab.
Images used by the site are under creative common use. unfortunately due
to the nature of users being able to upload pictures theoretically there could
be images not covered by creatic commons on the site. However anything I made
is fully covered.

The 'main' file would be index.js. this is the file that is ran to start the server And the file which everything comes together in.
